# WaZde

WaZde is an open-source and free music mixer and synthesizer.

##Software's presentation

It'll be written in c++, probably with Qt for the graphical interface and PortAudio to edit the sounds.
We knwow that we'll need to modify manually the hexadecimal code of the audio file.
In the software, the file will be edit in wav format.
Actually we are creating WaZde's design.

##Our presentation

We're two french guys, Raphael and Antoine.
I (Raphael) am fond of computer programming and i particularly love c++.
My friend Antoine is very interested in electronic music but greats synthesizers ar very expensive and as he also like computer programming, we decided to create our synthesizer.
We are doing that on our free time so this will be a very long project.

##Our targets


Our firsts targets are the begginers because at first time, because the software will be very simple and basic but as we'll work on the project, there will have more and more functions.
Maybe we'll create two mode, one basic and one expert.


Thanks for reading, Raphael.
